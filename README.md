- 👋 Hi, I’m @indrikwijaya
- 👀 I’m interested in developing and applying mathematical methods and machine learning algorithms for biology. I hope to develop a useful framework to analyze various spatial and temporal meta-omics data in the future.
In my free time, I enjoy reading non-fiction books and jogging along Singapore's river which is often visited by otters! Currently, I'm also reading Jordan Ellenberg's works.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning various meta-omics techniques including statistical analysis and building computational pipelines for scalability of the huge volume of data. 
Moreover, I'm also exploring the development of novel and powerful machine learning techniques, especially in their application to genomics.
